    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>The Wildcard Rule is introduced to the game to add difficulty in determining the probability of any quantity of dice being on the table.

A Wildcard is any dice that is a 1.  In this game, the Wildcards have a star to help signify them.  Wildcards count towards the quantity of every value.  Because they are so versatile, they also come with a consequence of betting the Wildcard.

If a player chooses to place a bet on a Wildcard such as "three Wildcards on the table", the quantity of dice is then doubled for the following player.  This means that the following player must double the quantity of dice unless he chooses to bet on the Wildcard again.  So, the player would be able to bet "six(twice of three) 2s on the table" or "four Wildcards on the table".

The same principle is applied when a player chooses to bet a Wildcard in the middle of the betting phase.  The player can choose to halve the current quantity of the previous bet and round it up to the nearest whole number to bet on the Wildcard.  For example, if the previous bet was "eight 5s on the table", the player must increase the quantity bet to nine and then proceed to half that amount.  Since you cannot bet "four and a half Wildcards on the table", the player must round up to "five Wildcards on the table".
</value>
  </data>
  <data name="label1.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Once a player chooses to call the previous player a liar, the reveal phase begins.

During the reveal phase, all players will show the rest of the players their dice.  The players will then check to see if the bet was true or if the player who placed the bet was a LIAR.  For example, if the bet was "eight 5s on the table", the players would count how many 5s and Wildcards are on the table.  If there are eight or more 5s on the table, then the player who called out LIAR will lose a dice.  If there are not at least eight 5s on the table, however, the player who place the bet of "eight 5s on the table" will lose a die.

Once it has been decided who was the LIAR and that palyer has lost a die, all players can reroll their remaining dice.  This will start a new hand.  The player who called LIAR in the last round becomes the player who starts the new round.  If that player has lost all of his dice, the following player beings turn.

  </data>
  <data name="BettingPhaseText.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When the betting phase begins, the player who is in charge of making the first move must place a bet on the table.  A bet is any combination of a quantity of dice and a value of the dice.  For example, a bet could be "I bet there are eight 5s on the table".

The objective is to guess how many of any value of die is on the table.

At the start of the betting phase, the first palyer can make any bet.  After his bet is placed, the next player must choose to increase the bet if he believes that the previous bet is true, or choose to call out the previous player as a LIAR and move to the reveal phase.

If the player chooses to increase the bet, he must either increase the quantiy of dice or the value of the dice.  For example, if a player bet "eight 5s on the table", the following player can either increase the bet to "eight 6s on the table" or "nine" of any dice one the table.

When placing bets, be sure to remember the Wildcard Rule as it makes the guess significantly harder than it would seem.

  <data name="StartingHandText.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There is no method to deciding who goes first in Liar's Dice.  In this adaptation of the game, the player who gets to go first is completely random.

At the start of a game, all players are given five dice.  These are the only dice the player will receive throughout the game.

When the round begins every player will roll their dice.  The dice that a player rolls are hidden from the other players.  No player should know what any other player has currently rolled.

After all players have had a chance to view their dice, the player who is starting that hand begins the betting phase.

  <data name="AboutTheGameText.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Liar's Dice is a class of dice games that can be played by two or more players and focuses on the players' abilities to deceive and detect their opponents' deception.  The game originated in South America and was played under a handful of different names such as Dudo, Perudo, Dadinho, and Cachito.

Throughout the game, players will take turns rolling their dice and attempting to make claims about how many dice of a certain value are on the table in that hand.  When a player thinks that the previous player may have guessed to many dice of a certain value, they can call the player a liar.  All player will reveal their dice and somebody will lose a die for lying.  The last player with any dice remaining is the winner.
